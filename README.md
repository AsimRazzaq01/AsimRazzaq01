# 👋 Hi there, I'm Asim

🎓 I'm a senior Software Engineering student at **Farmingdale State College**  
💻 I’m all about building apps that feel intuitive , fun and purposeful.
Whether it's designing clean mobile experiences or solving tough backend puzzles.
I like projects that challenge me *and* make life a little easier for me or someone else.
Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me:
- 💪 Hitting the gym
- 🎧 Getting lost in music 
- 🛠️ Tinkering with cars or my computer

I believe great software comes from curious, well-rounded minds — so I make time to explore, fix, build, and learn wherever I can.
